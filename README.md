# Nart
Nart is a terminal builded in wgpu (and winit for the creation of the window) and is thinked to be simple and lightweight with memory eficiency in mind

## TODOs
Nart is in really early development, it has mostly nothing builded yet, here's the list of things that lack to reach the objetive

- [x] Basic ui and shell creation
- [x] Text rendering (even though is done already, some things render weird, probably because an error from my part using cosmic-text)
- [x] Render a Cursor (Done but is broken)
- [ ] ANSI/VT100/etc codes support
- [ ] Job control
- [ ] Raw mode
- [ ] Scrollback
- [ ] Text selection
